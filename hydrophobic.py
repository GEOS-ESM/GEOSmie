"""

Specialized code that takes output from a calculation done for a
hydrophilic species and--using key '"hydrophobic:" true' from 
configuration file creates a new file with an additional index
in radius dimension, fills variables of hydrophilic dimension
(the second radius index) with the original file's outputs
and fills in the hydrophobic dimension (first radius index) with
RH=0 values of the hydrophilic calculation for all RH indices.
Returns new file. runoptics.py handles the file moving and
naming.
